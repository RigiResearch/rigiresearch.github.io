													<p><i><strong> We are continually faced with a series of great opportunities -- brilliantly disguised as insoluble problems.
													- John William Gardner
												</strong></i>
												</p>

										<p>
													My research project has been made possible by an NSERC Undergraduate Research Award and the support of my supervisor, Dr. Hausi Muller. I feel extremely grateful for the incredible opportunity to pursue my fascination with neural networks and machine learning with the support and guidance of the RIGI research team members.
										</p><p>
													The focus of my research project is to explore machine learning algorithms for intelligent cyber-physical systems. Machine learning is changing everyday activities through improvements in functions such as voice recognition, object detection, and image perception. Artificial neural networks can be highly effective in recognizing patterns and deriving trends. The aim of the project is to gain research skills, knowledge of best practices, and a broad understanding of existing usage.
</p><p>
													I was born and raised in Nelson, British Columbia. I have always had a passion for learning, and try to seize every opportunity to participate fully in my community, experience new things, and contribute wherever I can. When not focused on academic interests, I enjoy playing the piano, singing, skiing, hiking and windsurfing.
</p><p>
													Steve Jobs quote: “The people who are crazy enough to think they can change the world are the ones who do.”
</p><p>
													I hope to be one of those people.
